This is my stack of choice

Next.js on Vercel for the frontend. Postgres on Supabase for the backend. Live in that ecosystem while you are starting out. Quick builds and deployments are key when you are small. Start building your backend in Rust and migrate all of your functions from Next.js and Deno to Rust. Rust is a more sustainable solution long term.
