We live in an age now where you can deploy websites and web apps that scale to millions of users and pay absolutely nothing. With the emergence of platforms like [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), deploying code at scale has never been cheaper.

I had a conversation with [Christopher Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Michel) a few months ago and he talked about his time founding [Military.com](https://www.military.com/) and how it cost them almost $5,000,000 to get a website even started. That was to buy the warehouse space, get the right power into the building, setting up cooling, getting internet into the building, buy the servers, install the servers, hire the right people to set the servers up, and then get the software on the machine to even run the website. It was so cost prohibitive for people to launch internet businesses. Now, you can sit in a coffee shop with a laptop and run a website that serves millions of users and it costs you pennies.
