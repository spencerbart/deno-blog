title: My Thoughts on Apple's M series SOCs

I've been rocking a tited out M1 Max MacBook Pro 16in with 32GB of RAM and it is insane. The speed, the battery life, the screen. It is all just so perfect.

It's got me thinking a lot about developer productivity. Human capitol is so much more expensive than cloud costs, 9 times out of 10. Especially in the age of Deno Deploy, Cloudflare Workers, and Lambda Functions. You can have a website with a million users and spend $50 bucks on cloud resources between Vercel and Supabase. If an engineer wastes one hour of their time, it costs the same as an entire month's worth of cloud spend.

When you put that into perspective, you begin to realize that focusing on the developer experience is super critical. Engineers can't be waiting around for things to build so they can start coding. They just need to focus on the art of coding and abstract away all of the unessisary complexity.

The M series of Apple's ARM based SOCs are a step in this direction. More of a massive leap. They increase developer productivity by speeding build times.
