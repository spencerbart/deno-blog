It's freaking awesome. It is by far the most production ready web framework out there. With features like hybrid static & server rendering, automatic code splitting, route pre-fetching, api routes, layouts, and more, there is a reason why the biggest companies in the world choose to use Next.js for their core product. Everyone from TikTok, Walmart, Hulu, Twitch, Target, HBO Max, IGN, AT&T, Ticketmaster, Nintendo, Doordash, TED, Auth0, and so many more all use Next.js for their core product.

Couple Next.js with Vercel and you have one of the fastest and most pleasent Developer experiences ever. Gone are the days of complex DevOps with deploys that take an inordinate ammount of time. You can get a fully functioning website up and running that can handle millions of users within 10 minutes.
